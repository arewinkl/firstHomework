Homework assignment number one:

.The goal of this assignment was for us to take a look at an existing set of working code and refactor it (clean it up) without effecting the working code. we were tasked to do this by adding semantic tags to the code in places that would help make the code easier to read.

.Comments where left in the code next to the changes that were done. This was to let anyone who was looking at the code know exactly what was done to the code in case they didnt like the changes and wanted to revert it back to the original version.

.Alt tags where also added to the code next to the images, this way it would allow anyone who couldnt see the images know exactly what the image was demonstrating on the page.

.A discriptive title was also added to the code so that when the page was loaded in the browser, the visitor would know exactly what that page contained, just by taking a look at the tab.

.At the bottom of the page there was some information that was attached to the page, but in the istructional image for the assignment you could clearly see that that was not included. This was easy to take care of by simply commenting out that code. this is a much better option then simply deleting it. this way if the client ever wanted that information displayed again the code would be ready to go.

these are some of the changes that we were tasked with adressing in this first homework assignment.
